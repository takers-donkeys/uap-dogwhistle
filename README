Want to know how to make the dog whistle for "summoning" UAP ... Here's how ... super easy.
----------------------
Whatâ€™s in this signal:

7.83 Hz carrier (via modulated 100 Hz base tone - Schumann resonance)

528 Hz harmonic (spiritual frequency)

17 kHz ultrasonic ping (subtle, NHI tech-detectable - suspected)

Organic 2.5 kHz chirps (every 10 sec, like creature calls giving it a unique signature)

432 Hz ambient pad (smooth masking layer)

Breath layer (white noise shaped to feel "alive")
--------------------
Pulse it or play it straight .... low volume because volume does not matter in this context. Ta da.
